Genetic Algorithm Examples using Python 3
-----------------------------------------

Here we look at several ways Genetic Algorithms can be used to search large solution spaces efficiently.

Included so far are:

* Finding high-performing lineups for FanDuel competitions (see src/examples/fanduel.py)


## Preparing Environment ##
This uses Python 3.5.2.  To prepare a virtual environment and install all requirements, run the following commands:
```
python3 -m venv gaEnvironment
source gaEnvironment/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```
